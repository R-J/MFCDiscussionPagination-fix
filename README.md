This version of MFCDiscussionPagination includes just minor fixes to make the original plugin work with Vanilla 2.5 and 2.6. The rest is nearly untouched and all credits go to the original author, Stav the Wonderchicken.
The home page of the original plugin can be found here: https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/905/front-page-discussions-pagination
